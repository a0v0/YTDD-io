Buy Me A Coffee is a friendly way for creators to receive one-time and monthly support from their audience.

During the sign up process, you will be asked to enter your PayPal and Stripe details. If you missed that step, you can do this from your settings page any time.

There is no monthly fee, and all features are available to everyone. Creators are paid 95% of the amount after a 5% platform fee (a creator earning $50 will keep $47.5). Payment processing fees charged by PayPal and Stripe are also applicable.
